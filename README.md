Set up a Bootstrap 5 project. Directions and sample starter template code can be found here. We'll also go through setup ion class. 
Download and view the images in the compressed folder below. This is the site you're asked to create in this lab.
Use the Bootstrap 5 grid system and components to replicate the site depicted in the images. You may use the template files as a starting place if you wish. Remember that you will need to use at least one container (.container or .container-fluid; each has its own quirks and benefits, so pick one and stick with it) plus rows and columns to achieve this.
Adjust the default Bootstrap styling in a custom stylesheet, changing and customizing font, color, margins, padding, and whatever else you need to make your Bootstrap layout beautiful, unique, and responsive.
Compress/zip the project into a single project directory/folder (as usual, it should be entitled LastnameFirstinitialA4!) and upload it here by the deadline.
